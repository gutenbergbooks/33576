<p><b>FORCED ACQUAINTANCES.</b> By <span class="smcap">Edith Robinson</span>. 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p class="cont">A famous American author writes that this is "a very amusing and
well-told story, original and infinitely amusing. The differences in character
and temperament, the thousand and one little situations that are
derived from these differences, are very cleverly delineated. The elaboration
of the narrative, which winds along through the household duties and
the neighbors' peculiarities, is something after the style of Miss Austen."</p>

speaker, and the circumstances attending each remark, is also given. This

new indexes and tables of authors, and the addition of over fifty pages,
bringing the work down to the latest time, and quoting eighty authors not

Agassiz, Choate, President Cleveland, Emerson, Evarts, Carlyle, Gladstone,
Wellington, Parnell, etc.</p>

Changes in the History of the World. Arranged by Centuries, with

<b>SONS AND DAUGHTERS.</b> By the author of "The Story of Margaret
Kent." 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p class="cont">An eminent Boston critic writes: "This should be <em class="smcap">the</em> novel of the
season. The lively fancy of the author touches lightly and wittily upon
several of the popular interests of the day, such as Shakespeare societies,
the Browning craze, mind cure, etc., and from titlepage to finis there is
not a dull paragraph. So brilliant and entertaining a story as 'Sons and
Daughters' is not often met with, and it should have, as it deserves, the
widest reading."</p>

<p class="cont">The remarkable popularity and great sales which made "Margaret
Kent" one of the foremost books of the last year (or of the last decade)
seem likely to be repeated in this new novel by the same author. It sparkles
with the real life and deep feeling, and has the same admirable social
setting, that have made "Margaret Kent" a name to conjure by wherever
the best of literature is known.</p>


<p><b>HAPPY DODD.</b> By <span class="smcap">Rose Terry Cooke</span>, author of "The Deacon's

spirit of Christian love and heroism.</p>

Beautifully illustrated. 75 cents.</p>


<p><b>THE EVOLUTION OF THE SNOB.</b> By <span class="smcap">Thomas Sergeant
Perry</span>. 16mo. $1.00.</p>

<p class="cont">A keen and brilliant social study, by one of the most spirited writers of
Boston.</p>


<p><b>GOETHE'S FAUST: A Commentary.</b> By <span class="smcap">Denton J. Snider</span>.
2 vols. 12mo. $3.50.</p>

<p class="cont">A learned and valuable treatise on the greatest of German poems, giving
its history, critical standards, and outline, and careful analyses and explanations
of all the scenes and situations, as seen from a philosophical point
of view.</p>


<p><b>SCOTT'S THE LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL.</b> An entirely
new edition of this famous and popular poem, from <em>new plates</em>, with
nearly <em>one hundred</em> new illustrations by leading American artists.
Elegantly and appropriately bound, with full gilt edges. In box.
Cloth, $6.00; padded calf, tree-calf, or antique morocco, $10.00. A
few copies in crushed Levant, with silk linings, $25.00.</p>

<p class="cont">"The Lay of the Last Minstrel" is larger than its predecessors, the Holiday
volumes published under Mr. Anthony's supervision, and its broad and
handsome pages offer very favorable opportunities for the display of the
illustrations, which are masterpieces of modern engraving.</p>

<p class="cont">The immediate and permanent success of "The Lady of the Lake,"
"Marmion," etc., has encouraged the publishers to bring out this not less
popular and famous poem. It is produced in the same style, and with the
same careful and elaborate style of illustration, regardless of cost, while Mr.
Anthony's skilful supervision is sufficient guarantee that the work is elegant
and tasteful as well as correct.</p>


<p><b>THE PETERKIN PAPERS.</b> By <span class="smcap">Lucretia P. Hale</span>. New Holiday
edition, revised and enlarged, uniform with "Davy and the Goblin."
Square 4to. Illustrated with a great number of new pictures. $1.50.</p>

<p class="cont">The continued popularity of these inimitable stories has compelled the issue
of this new and enlarged edition, with new illustrations and type. "The
Lady from Philadelphia," "Agamemnon," "Solomon John," and other
characters of these stories have become household words in thousands of
American families; and the publication of a worthy and comely edition of
so delightful a classic will be hailed with joy by many old friends and new.</p>

<b>MURAL PAINTING.</b> By <span class="smcap">Frederic Crowninshield</span>. 1 vol. Square
8vo. With numerous diagrams and full-page illustrations. $3.00.</p>

<p class="cont">This series of papers has excited great interest and attention in "The
American Architect;" and in its present enlarged and amended form, with
many new illustrations, is still more valuable.</p>

<p><b>SONGS AND SATIRES.</b> A volume of poems. By <span class="smcap">James Jeffrey
Roche</span>. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.00.</p>

<p class="cont">The range and versatility of these poems add to their other attractions, and
make the volume a very popular one. Mr. Roche's <i>vers de soci√©t√©</i>, printed
in "Life," and other publications, are of singular delicacy and originality,
and the best of them are incorporated in this volume, together with many
heretofore unpublished poems.</p>


<p><b>GENIUS IN SUNSHINE AND IN SHADOW.</b> By <span class="smcap">M. M. Ballou</span>,
author of "Edge-tools of Speech." 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p class="cont">Mr. Ballou has for many years been known as one of the most industrious,
accurate, and entertaining of American scholars. The present volume (his
latest work) is a peculiarly interesting one, full of anecdotes and <i>memorabilia</i>,
which set forth the intimate inner lives of the world's heroes and
notables. They have been gathered from the most recondite sources, and
skilfully massed in attractive array, forming a great collection, that is at
once valuable and interesting.</p>

<h3>A WONDERFUL WORK OF ART.</h3>

<p class="center">Mrs. Browning's Love Sonnets.</p>

<p><b>SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE.</b> By <span class="smcap">Elizabeth Barrett
Browning</span>. Illustrated by <span class="smcap">Ludvig Sand√∂e Ipsen</span>. 1 vol.
Oblong folio (pages 13 √ó 16 inches), beautifully bound, gilt top. $15.00;
full tree-calf, $30.00.</p>

<p class="cont">This magnificent work has been a labor of love for years with the artist,
who is the prince of decorators, and has lavished upon it all the resources of
his imagination and skill. The result is a magnificent monument to the
poems that are enshrined therein, and a series of designs, the equals of
which as a mere treasury of decoration and invention, apart from their significance
in illustrating the immortal verse of Mrs. Browning, have never
been issued in America. Each sonnet is prefaced by a richly ornamental
half-title, on a full page, and is surrounded by a handsome border, emblematic
in its design and composition. Mr. Ipsen has for many years been
recognized as the foremost leader of art-decoration for books, both inside
and outside, and has set more fashions for imitation than any other artist.
This book is his crowning work, and will afford an inexhaustible treasury of
decoration for students of art, and a life-study for all lovers of beauty and
symmetry. Mrs. Browning's sonnets are among the noblest productions
of ancient or modern literature; and their literary excellence and incomparable
beauty of diction insure for them certain immortality.</p>

<p><b>RECOLLECTIONS OF EMINENT MEN, and Other Papers.</b>

<p class="cont"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" id="Page_22" title="[Pg 22]"></a>
A new book by Mr. Whipple is a literary event; and so many years have

<p class="cont">The author is, perhaps, the best living authority on Persia, and this book

his residence as United States Minister, combining novel and entertaining

value. His rare skill as a landscape painter has availed to give many choice
pictures of the great Asiatic realm, with its stores of poetry and legend, its
strange customs, and its romantic scenery and architecture.</p>

of underlying tragedy," says Nora Perry, in <span class="source">The Independent.</span></p>

<p class="cont">"A bitter, caustic, stinging satire, a book of power."&mdash;<span class="source">Chicago Times.</span></p>


<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" id="Page_23" title="[Pg 23]"></a>

<p class="cont">Mr. Wertheimber, of a scholarly Austrian family, went to Japan about
the year 1870, and spent many years there, in the service of the Japanese
Government. He was an extensive traveller among the inland districts and

condensed the fruits of years of curious research in a strange and unfamiliar
field. The result is a rarely entertaining volume of great value to all

was privately printed some time since, and met with such praise and appreciation
that Senator Morrill has since carefully revised and materially
augmented it for publication.</p>


<p><b>THE MINISTER'S CHARGE.</b> By <span class="smcap">W. D. Howells</span>, author of "The
Rise of Silas Lapham," "Indian Summer," etc. $1.50.</p>

<p class="cont">"In this great novel of the people Henry James finds that Mr. Howells
touches high-water mark; and sees an important and valuable work in this
minute and subtle registering of the heavy-witted countryman's slow development
under city conditions. However that may be, Howells's pure,
inimitable fun is enough to carry any story he may write. Like all true
fun, this has a most searching pathos all the time just at hand; and never
is the real dignity of character of this actual Yankee forgotten or trifled
with."&mdash;<span class="source">Boston Transcript.</span></p>
